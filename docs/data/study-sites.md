# Study Sites

Five national parks across five countries, each with a park (managed) and control (unmanaged) site, giving 10 study sites total.

## Parks

| Park | Country | ISO | Biome / Key Habitats |
|---|---|---|---|
| Akagera | Rwanda | RW | Savanna woodland, wetlands, grassland, mountain |
| Zakouma | Chad | TD | Flood plain, savanna, woodland, grassland |
| Odzala-Kokoua | Republic of the Congo | CG | Tropical forest, bai (forest clearings) |
| Iona | Angola | AO | Desert (dune, gravel plain, grass plain), riverine |
| Kafue | Zambia | ZM | Woodland, flood plain, grassland, shrubland |

## Study Design

Each park has two sampling locations:

- **park** — inside the managed protected area
- **control** — outside park boundaries; unmanaged comparison area

This paired design enables measurement of conservation management effectiveness by comparing biodiversity and ecosystem structure between managed and unmanaged sites.

## Study Site Identifiers

In the schema, each study site is identified as `{park_name}-{location_type}`:

| Study Site ID | Park | Location | Country |

| `Akagera-park` | Akagera | park | Rwanda |
| `Akagera-control` | Akagera | control | Rwanda |
| `Zakouma-park` | Zakouma | park | Chad |
| `Zakouma-control` | Zakouma | control | Chad |
| `Odzala-Kokoua-park` | Odzala-Kokoua | park | Republic of the Congo |
| `Odzala-Kokoua-control` | Odzala-Kokoua | control | Republic of the Congo |
| `Iona-park` | Iona | park | Angola |
| `Iona-control` | Iona | control | Angola |
| `Kafue-park` | Kafue | park | Zambia |

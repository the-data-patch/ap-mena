Sequencing method and SRA coordination questions sent to Jonah Ventures. Responses needed to finalize schema and SRA metadata.

See: [Questions for Jonah Ventures](https://the-data-patch.github.io/ap-mena/questions/jonah-ventures/)

## Critical (blocks SRA)
- [ ] Sequencing platform and instrument (faecal amplicon)
- [ ] Library prep protocol (faecal amplicon)
- [ ] 12S vertebrate primer pair (name + sequence)
- [ ] trnL primer pair (name + sequence)
- [ ] Sequencing platform and instrument (soil shotgun)
- [ ] Library prep protocol (soil shotgun)
- [ ] Confirm SRA upload workflow
- [ ] FASTQ format and mapping file

## Important (blocks GBIF)
- [ ] Bioinformatics pipeline (faecal amplicon)
- [ ] Bioinformatics pipeline (soil shotgun)
- [ ] Reference database(s) for taxonomic assignment
- [ ] % identity threshold for species-level ID
- [ ] Filtering/decontamination steps

## Helpful (clarifies schema)
- [ ] RunId date-vs-code explanation
- [ ] `DNA_Species_Type_Consensus` definition
- [ ] `RRA_Prey` definition
- [ ] `RepESVId` definition
- [ ] `Reads` column: raw or filtered?
- [ ] `NEW COMMENT` column contents
- [ ] `samples/YEAR` column meaning

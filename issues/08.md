Water eDNA sequencing questions for CBO, University of Porto.

## Critical (blocks SRA)
- [ ] Sequencing platform and instrument
- [ ] Library prep protocol
- [ ] 16SU primer pair (name + sequence)
- [ ] Vertebrate 12S primer pair — same as Jonah Ventures or different?
- [ ] SRA upload: Porto uploads, or African Parks coordinates?

## Important
- [ ] DNA extraction kit/protocol
- [ ] Filtration method details
- [ ] Bioinformatics pipeline
- [ ] Reference database(s)

## Data
- [ ] Are water results files available yet?
- [ ] When expected?

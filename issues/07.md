Project-level and policy questions for Jordana Morgan Meyer and African Parks leadership.

## Critical
- [ ] Official project name for BioProject registration
- [ ] Additional institutional collaborators to acknowledge
- [ ] GBIF license decision: CC-BY-NC vs CC-BY vs CC0
- [ ] Coordinate sensitivity policy for endangered species (e.g., black rhino GPS)

## Important
- [ ] Field collection protocols (soil, water, faecal) — for protocol registration
- [ ] Negative controls and blanks: collected? tracked separately?
- [ ] `species_id_field` vs `DNA_species_ID` precedence for host ID
- [ ] Physical sample repository identified?

## Schema Clarifications
- [ ] `Ecological_Guild`: based on host species or diet results?
- [ ] `species_code`: encoding scheme?
- [ ] `swab` field meaning
- [ ] `latrine` field meaning
- [ ] `Reruns` field meaning
- [ ] Faecal metadata ↔ 12S results relationship (one-to-many confirmed?)
- [ ] Duplicate barcode_ids across sample types?
- [ ] Water metadata missing country column — correction or infer?
